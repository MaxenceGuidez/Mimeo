## How is Mimeo
To create Mimeo, I use the Unity game engine with the C# language for scripting. About the IDE I like Rider, so I use it for Mimeo, and finally how to make a projet in 2024 without our friend ChatGPT? So I use him sometimes but also all information, videos and documentations online.
